Project Scaffolding & Workflow Guide (Scalable Version)
This guide outlines a scalable file structure for a static website designed to host multiple compiled Pygame applications and easily accommodate new content sections.

1. The File Structure
This structure separates your projects, making them independent and easier to manage.

your-project-folder/
├── games/
│   ├── asteroid-shooter/
│   │   ├── main.py
│   │   └── assets/
│   └── platformer-game/
│       ├── main.py
│       └── assets/
│
├── src/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── data.json
│
├── dist/
│   └── (This folder is created during the build step)
│
└── README.md

Folder Breakdown:

/games/ (Plural)

Purpose: This parent folder now holds all of your individual game projects.

Each game gets its own subfolder (e.g., /asteroid-shooter/, /platformer-game/). This is crucial. It keeps each game's code and assets completely separate.

/src/ (Source)

Purpose: Contains the source files for your main website.

index.html: Your main website file. This will act as the "shell" for your application.

data.json: The "database" for your trading logs, blog posts, and now, a list of your games.

/dist/ (Distribution)

Purpose: This folder will contain the final, ready-to-deploy version of your website. Never edit files here directly. It's the "build" output. This is the only folder you will upload to your host.

2. The Development Workflow
The process is similar, but we now repeat steps for each game.

Step 1: Develop

To work on your website: Edit files in /src/. Open src/index.html in your browser to preview.

To work on a game: Navigate to its specific folder (e.g., /games/platformer-game/) and work on the code there. Run python games/platformer-game/main.py to test it locally.

Step 2: Build the Game(s) for the Web

When you're ready to update your games, you run the build command for each game project individually.

Open your terminal.

Run the pygbag command on the first game's folder:

pygbag games/asteroid-shooter/

Run the command for the second game:

pygbag games/platformer-game/

This creates a build/web folder inside each of your game directories.

Step 3: Assemble the Final Website

This "build" step combines your website shell and all your compiled games into the final dist folder.

Clear the dist folder: Delete everything inside it to ensure a clean build.

Copy website files: Copy index.html and data.json from /src/ into /dist/.

Copy game builds: For each game, copy its build/web folder into dist/ and rename it to match the game's folder name.

Copy games/asteroid-shooter/build/web to dist/asteroid-shooter.

Copy games/platformer-game/build/web to dist/platformer-game.

After this step, your /dist/ folder will be perfectly organized:

dist/
├── index.html
├── data.json
├── asteroid-shooter/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── (other pygbag files)
└── platformer-game/
    ├── index.html
    └── (other pygbag files)

Step 4: Deploy

Upload the entire contents of the /dist/ folder to your static hosting provider. Your index.html can then link to the games at ./asteroid-shooter/ and ./platformer-game/.

3. How to Make It Scalable & Modifiable
This structure makes adding new content incredibly simple.

To add a new Website Section:

Add a new navigation link in src/index.html.

Create the new div for your section's content within src/index.html. Your existing tab-switching JavaScript will handle the rest.

Follow the build process to copy the updated index.html to dist/ and deploy.

To add a new Pygame Game:

Create a new folder for your game inside the /games/ directory (e.g., games/new-puzzle-game/).

Write your game code and assets in that new folder.

(Optional but Recommended): Add an entry for your new game in src/data.json. Your JavaScript in index.html can read this to dynamically create the list of games to choose from.

Follow the build process: run pygbag on your new game's folder, copy the result to dist/, and deploy.

By following this pattern, you can add dozens of games and sections to your site without the codebase becoming a tangled mess. Each part remains independent and easy to update.
